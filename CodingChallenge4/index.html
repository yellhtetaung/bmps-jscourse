    <h1>Coding Challenge #4</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Steven wants to build a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes to eat in a restaurant in his country,
        it's usual to tip 15% if the bill value is between 50 and 300. If the value is different, the tip is 20%.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul style="list-style: number;">
      <li>
        Your task is to calculate the tip, depending on the bill value. Create a variable called 'tip' for this. It's
        not allowed to use an if/else statement (If it's easier for you, you can start with an if/else statement, and
        then try to convert it to a ternary operator!)
      </li>
      <li>
        Print a string to the console containing the bill value, the tip, and the final value(bill + tip). Example: 'The
        bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and the total value 316.25'
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span>Test data: </span>Test for bill values 275, 40 and 430
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Hint: </span>To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it by 20/100 = 0.2
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Hint: </span>Value x is between 50 and 300, if it's >= 50 && <= 300 </li>
    </ul>

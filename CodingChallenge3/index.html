    <h1>Coding Challenge 3</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        There are two gymnastics teams, Dolphins and Koalas. They compete against each other 3 times. The winner with
        the
        highest average score wins the trophy!
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul style="list-style: number;">
      <li>
        Calculate the average score for each team, using the test data below
      </li>
      <li>
        Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the competition, and print it to the console. Don't
        forget that there can be a draw, so test for that as well (a draw means they have the same average score).
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Bonus 1: </span>include a requirement for a minimum score of 100. With this rule, a team only wins if it
        has a higher score than the other team, and at the same time a score of at least 100 points. <span>Hint: </span>
        Use a logical operator to test for a minimum score, as well as multiple else-if blocks
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Bonus 2: </span>Minimum score also applies to a draw! So a draw only happens when both teams have the some
        score and both have a score greater or equal to 100 points. Otherwise, no team wins the trophy.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span>Test data: </span>Dolphins score 96, 108, and 89. Koalas score 88, 91, and 110
